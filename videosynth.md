Program  input
algebra = 

algebra over sound frequency maybe or amplitude

1. make it digital
2. sound can be processed trhough amplification and physical manifestation whereas video must be interpreted
3. matrix math, gradients, split the screen into multiple matrices; configure palacement and size in real-time
4. frame intervals always, never continuous 
5. Could look at difference between last frame and this frame, or extrapolate from last ten differences
6. Sound over time has three dimensions, whereas an individual frame only has 2. 
7. Program could define sound in terms of frequency, harmonics, amplitude etc.
8. input (program) is multi-dimensional structure. Connections / interpretations / mappings (functions)
9. Game 
10. how would you paramterize game of life? 
 - start spots
 - rate
 - where propagation happens (where are new births)
 - actual pattern
 - rate of birth 
 - meaning of "frames"
 - periodicity (could look at 2 frames ago instead of one frame ago) could take two states as input -- "smoothness"
 - arbitrary interp of x/y values
 - interpret multiple frames (of the game) instead of just one
11. could mirror wave on x-axis to have it be rectangle and map directly to matrix
12. input/program is always arbitrary; no "natural" meaning for the 
13. could re-paramaterize the size of the rectangle apply, then re-interpret (extrapolate, expand) into the original size
14. Use 4x4 to filter colors, use 16x16 for another value
15. film burn blooming out -- going backwards from a type of image or animation
16. input (program) is video: 
17. wavetable synthesis . . . granular synthesis (sampling) --- z axis is time over an animation.
17.5 generate flip book. could game of life (spreading) or could work backward from discrete shapes 
17.6 take video/animation, pull apart the spatial components (i.e., legs, head, etc) 
17.7 go from small time sample and break it apart (ie spatially or semantically or by color) and turn them into a longer piece
17.8 how could you apply wavetable synthesis tools or even harmonic products to video, which has an extra dimension or two
18. analog meters (CC midi) like brightness, color, etc, straightforward. How manipulate space? 
19. filtering video, modulating video. i.e., start with white, and a filled rectangle
20. Grammar: proximity (adjancency, etc) and manifested structure is important v. algebra
21. Sampling video in diff. ways
22. sound metrics and pivot points; data model
interpreter pattern and/or grammars/state machines

the algorithm seperate from how it's interpreted
algorithm "program" could be the game of life or sound. This could be interpreted like . . . color, or true/false in game of life is black/white, 
or freeze-framed sound is white pixels on a cartesian plane
